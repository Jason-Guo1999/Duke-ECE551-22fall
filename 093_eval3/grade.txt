Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2   cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step1.o story.o page.o helperFunction.o myException.o
g++    -c -o cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2   cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step1.o story.o page.o helperFunction.o myException.o
g++    -c -o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step2.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------
------------------------------------
You have requested that we check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2
