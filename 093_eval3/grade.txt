Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step1 cyoa-step2  cyoa-step3 cyoa-step4 cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step4.o Story.o Page.o Choice.o helperFunction.o myException.o
g++  -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3  -c -o cyoa-step1.o cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -std=gnu++98 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
